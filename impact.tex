\section{Importance/Impact}
This paper has a big impact on the computer since and was cited more than 3000 times by other papers. A wide area onion routing network was briefly deployed but it was not really used because it required a seperate "application proxy" for each supported application protocol and most of them where never written. Tor uses the standard and near-ubquitous SOCKS proxy interface, which support most TCP-based programs without modification.
Because of that tor is used in the world wide web since 2004 for anonymous connections. Individuals use Tor for censorship circumvention to reach othervise blocked content, to keep websites from tracking them or their family members, to publish services without needed to reveal the location of them or for sensitive communication. Tor is also used by companies or Journalists to communicate with whistleblowers\cite{tor}. But Tor is also used by criminals to sell drugs, child porns, weapons or other illegal things.
