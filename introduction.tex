\section{Introduction}
The paper \textit{Tor: Second-Generation Onion Router} was written by Roger Dingledine, Nick Mathewson and Paul Syverson in the year 2004. 
It describes a circuit based low-latency anonymous communication system called Tor. 
Tor based on the concept of Onion Routing, which was first published in the paper \textit{Hiding routing information} in 1996 \cite{goldschlag1996hiding}. 
Onion Routing is also a low latency and circuit based communication system.
A low latency network is a network that experiences small delay times \cite{latency}.
Because of that Tor is able to anonymize interactive network traffic and can used in the world wide web. Circuit based means that Tor establishes  circuits across the network to communicate.
